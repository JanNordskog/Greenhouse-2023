# Greenhouse-2023
# Concept of a Greenhouse
A greenhouse is a structure with walls and a roof made chiefly of transparent material, like glass, in which plants requiring regulated climatic conditions are grown. These structures range in size from small sheds to industrial-sized buildings. A key aspect of a greenhouse is its ability to control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light levels, and sometimes carbon dioxide levels to optimize plant growth.

# Purpose of the Greenhouse Application

## Monitoring and Control
The application allows for real-time monitoring and control of various actuators and sensors within the greenhouse. Actuators include systems for adjusting temperature and humidity, while sensors measure these environmental conditions.

## Data Handling and Communication
It involves a communication channel for transmitting sensor data from the greenhouse to the control system and sending commands back to the greenhouse actuators.

## Event Notification
The system notifies users of changes in the greenhouse environment, such as when new sensor data is received or when an actuator's state changes. This is crucial for timely interventions to maintain optimal conditions.

## User Interface (GUI)
A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided for easier interaction with the system. Users can view real-time data, receive alerts, and control actuators through this interface.

## Simulated Environment for Testing
The code snippets indicate the presence of a simulated greenhouse environment for testing purposes. This is useful for developing and testing the system without the need for a physical greenhouse setup.

# Why a Greenhouse Needs This Type of Software

- **Optimized Plant Growth**: By precisely controlling environmental factors, the software helps in creating the ideal conditions for plant growth, which can lead to higher yields and better quality crops.

- **Efficiency and Energy Saving**: Automated control can optimize resource use, reducing waste and saving energy.

- **Remote Management**: The software allows for remote monitoring and control, which means a person does not need to be physically present in the greenhouse to adjust conditions.

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Collecting and analyzing data over time can help in making informed decisions to improve greenhouse operations.

In summary, this greenhouse application represents a sophisticated system for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of greenhouse farming, leveraging technology to automate and optimize the growth environment for plants.

## Running the application

To run our game engine, run the following command:

    mvn clean package javafx:run

If this doesn't work you have to run GreenhouseGuiStarter first and then run controlpanelstarter

## Installing
To install the `.jar` file that can be used for running our game engine, run the following command:

    mvn clean install

## Testing
To run the unit tests, use the following command:

    mvn clean test
